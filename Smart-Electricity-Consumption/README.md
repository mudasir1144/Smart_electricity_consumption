# ⚡ Smart Electricity Consumption Prediction System

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Smart Electricity Consumption Prediction System** is a Machine Learning-based web application developed using **Python** and **Streamlit**. The system predicts the daily electricity consumption of a household based on user-provided information such as house type, appliance usage, weather conditions, and household characteristics.

In addition to predicting electricity consumption, the application provides personalized energy-saving recommendations, estimates monthly electricity bills, and evaluates household energy efficiency.
